--  You might have encountered unusual or erroneous rows in the dataset. Can you conclude which vendor is doing a bad job in 
--   providing the records using different columns of the dataset? Summarise your conclusions based on every column where these 
--   errors are present. For example, There are unusual passenger count, i.e. 0 which is unusual.
--So for this we need to check every column and analysis which vendor is providing more error in records.

-- First, let's check for passenger counts.
select vendorid, Passenger_count as No_of_passengers, count(*) as No_of_records from nyc_data 
group by vendorid, passenger_count order by vendorid, passenger_count;
-- From results it can be seen that vendorid 1 provided 6813 records for number of passengers as 0 but vendorid 2 provided 11 records only.
-- Apart from that number of passengers are in range 0 to 9 so except 0 all records are accepted.

--Second, let's check for the distance of trip. As trip distance can not be less than 0 as distance can not be negative.
select vendorid, count(Trip_distance) as No_of_records from nyc_data where trip_distance<0 group by vendorid;
--This column is clean, No errors.

--Third, let's check for ratecodeid, It can only take values of 1,2,3,4,5 and 6 only other than that is error.
select vendorid, RateCodeID, count(*) as No_of_records from nyc_data group by vendorid, RateCodeID order by vendorid, RateCodeID;
--Both vendors have a error ratecodeid 99 and it's values are as followes: For vendorid 1 = 8 records and for vendorid 2 = 1 record.

--Forth, Store_and_fwd_flag this column can only take values: Y and N.
select vendorid, Store_and_fwd_flag, count(*) as No_of_records 
from nyc_data group by vendorid, Store_and_fwd_flag order by vendorid, Store_and_fwd_flag;
--Vendor 2 never stored and forwerded any record but vendor 1 stored 3951 records may be because of server problem.
--As vendor 1 stored some recordes there are chances that these records are manupulated before sending to the vendor.

--Fifth, let's check for Payment_type, It can only take values of 1,2,3,4,5 and 6 only other than that is error.
select vendorid, Payment_type, count(*) as No_of_records 
from nyc_data group by vendorid, Payment_type order by vendorid, Payment_type;
--This column looks clean

--Sixth, let's check for Fare_amount, It can not take less than 0 values.
select vendorid, count(Fare_amount) as No_of_records from nyc_data where Fare_amount<0 group by vendorid;
-- Vendor id 2 have 558 records having negative fare amount.

--Seventh, let's check for the values of Extras entered in records. 
select vendorid, Extra, count(*) No_of_records from nyc_data group by vendorid, Extra order by vendorid, Extra;
--Extra can only take 0, 0.5 and 1 as valid values. Every thing else is error. Now let's count the number of error records for both vendors.
select vendorid, count(*) from nyc_data where Extra !=0 and Extra!= 0.5 and Extra!= 1 group by vendorid;
--Vendor 2 have 3033 error records and vendor 1 have 1823 error records.

--Eight, let's check for MTA_tax. 0 and 0.5 values are permitted for MTA_tax everything else is error.
select vendorid, MTA_tax, count(*) as No_of_records from nyc_data group by vendorid, mta_tax order by vendorid, mta_tax;
--Vendor 1 have 1 error record and vendor 2 have 4 error record.

--Nine, let's check for Improvement_surcharge. 0 and 0.3 values are permitted for MTA_tax everything else is error.
select vendorid, Improvement_surcharge, count(*) as No_of_records 
from nyc_data group by vendorid, Improvement_surcharge order by vendorid, Improvement_surcharge;
--Vendor 2 have 562 error records and Vendor 1 have no error records.

--Tenth, let's check for Tip_amount. Tip amount can't be negative.
select vendorid, count(*) as No_of_records from nyc_data where tip_amount<0 group by vendorid;
--Vendor 2 have 4 error records and Vendor 1 have no error records.

--Eleventh, let's check for Tolls_amount. It can not be negative.
select vendorid, count(*) as No_of_records from nyc_data where Tolls_amount<0 group by vendorid;
--Vendor 2 have 3 error records and Vendor 1 have no error records.

--Twelth, let's check for Total_amount. It can not be negative.
select vendorid, count(*) as No_of_records from nyc_data where Total_amount<0 group by vendorid;
--Vendor 2 have 558 error records and Vendor 1 have no error records.

--Last, let's check the duration of trip. It can not be negative.
select vendorid, count(*) as No_of_records from nyc_data 
where  (UNIX_TIMESTAMP(tpep_dropoff_datetime)-UNIX_TIMESTAMP(tpep_pickup_datetime)) < 0 group by vendorid;
--Vendor 1 have 73 records having negative time duration this is error.

--Based on the above Analysis we can say that vendor 2 is doing a bad job in providing the records.

--Now let's move to analysis-I part

--Average fare per trip for November is $12.91 and for December is $12.71.
--From this we can say there is not much of a difference Average fare per trip for both months.

--2) Explore the ‘number of passengers per trip’ - how many trips are made by each level of ‘Passenger_count’? 
--   Do most people travel solo or with other people?
select Passenger_count, count(*) as No_of_trips, count(*)/1155418*100 as percentage_of_trips 
from nyc_data_orc group by Passenger_count;
--trips are made by each level of Passenger_count are as follow:

--so the ‘average tip’ is not a representative statistic (of the central tendency) of ‘tip amount paid’.

--5) Explore the ‘Extra’ (charge) variable - what fraction of total trips have an extra charge is levied?

--3) Which month has a greater average ‘speed’ - November or December?
